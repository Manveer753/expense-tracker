# Expense Tracker: 
• Built with React and hosted on Netlify.

• Users can add and remove expenses.

• Users can also filter expenses by year. 

• Expenses are stored in localStorage, so they persist even after the 
user exits the application. 

### The project is hosted [here](https://peaceful-pie-210a5d.netlify.app/)
